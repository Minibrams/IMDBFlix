# IMDBFlix
Chrome extension that automatically fetches IMDB scores when hovering over movies on Netflix.
Not really bug free, but works most of the time. 

## API
Uses the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) to fetch the scores. As seen in the manifest, you need a file called "APIKEY.js" contaning one variable called `API_KEY` set to whatever your API key is.
